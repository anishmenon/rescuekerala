# Optimization Todo list

- Anish Menon

What i'm suggesting to do are 

# Application level 
  - Django Celery
  - Redis ( Broker )
  - Memchached 
  
Please handle all requests asynchronous ( non-blocking) its easy to do with celery and redis/rabbitMQ . 

Add cache setiings with memchached 

# Server level:
 - Nginx with upstream servers
 - HA proxy
